# Chizu
Chizu is a small project where I played with the possibilies of directx and shaders.

Chizu is rendering a 2D map based on coordinates of cities. The number of coordinates can be huge.
Therefore I wanted to test the performance of accessing directx directly, to have less intermediate process.
It can render a map of world cities (3,000,000 coordinates) quite fast.

You can execute the file located in Debug on a windows 8 platform.
